# Therapist Bot
This bot uses Google Gemini API keys. Get your key at [https://ai.google.dev/#develop-with-gemini](https://ai.google.dev/#develop-with-gemini).

Then create a file under the root project folder named `.env`. The file will contain text formatted as this:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=api_key
```

Put your API key after the `=` sign.
